                    Sahara, (from Arabic ṣaḥrāʾ, “desert”) largest desert in the world. The Sahara is bordered in the west by the Atlantic Ocean, in the north by the Atlas Mountains and Mediterranean Sea, in the east by the Red Sea, and in the south by the Sahel—a semiarid region that forms a transitional zone between the Sahara to the north and the belt of humid savannas to the south.<em>(credit: Encyclopedia Britannica)</em> <br>

The Gobi (from Mongolian gobi, meaning “waterless place”) stretches across huge portions of both Mongolia and China. Contrary to the perhaps romantic image long associated with what—at least to the European mind—was a remote and unexplored region, much of the Gobi is not sandy desert but bare rock.<em>(credit: Encyclopedia Britannica)</em> <br>

                <p>
                    The Chara Sands is an area of sand in Siberia near the Kodar and Udokan mountain ranges.[1] It is a small desert 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) wide by 6 kilometers (3.7 mi) long, located in the Charsk basin amid the valleys of Chara, Middle Sakukan and Upper Sakukan rivers. The rapid change from the pine and larch forests and peat bogs to the sand has no transition zone—this is one of the peculiarities of this unusual area, besides the roaming sand dunes and the oases that emerge among them.<em>(credit: Wikipedia)</em> <br>

                    It was named by Charles Sturt in 1844, while he was trying to find the inland sea which he believed lay at the centre of Australia.[1] The stones caused his horses to limp and wore down the hooves of the cattle and sheep which Sturt had taken on the expedition.
